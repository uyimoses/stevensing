						I heard that you're settled down
						That you found a girl and you're married now
						I heard that your dreams came true
						Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you

						Old friend, why are you so shy?
						Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

						I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
						But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
						I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
						That for me, it isn't over
